## Install

For the latest release, go to [the releases
section](https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/choose/releases) and download the
binary.

### Homebrew installation

> Keep in mind that we do not maintain the homebrew formula here! So check the
> version you have via `choose -v` and compare it to the latest version in [the
> releases section](https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/choose/releases) .

```bash
brew install choose-gui
```

### Build and Install Documentation

From root of repository, run:

```bash
make docs
make install-docs
```

You can then issue `man choose` to read the manual.

Note that this requires `pandoc` to be installed on your system to build the
manual page.

## Usage

### List the content from current directory

```bash
ls | choose
```

### Open apps from the applications directories

```bash
ls /Applications/ /Applications/Utilities/ /System/Applications/ /System/Applications/Utilities/ | \
    grep '\.app$' | \
    sed 's/\.app$//g' | \
    choose | \
    xargs -I {} open -a "{}.app"
```

### Use as a snippet manager

Suppose you have some snippets in a text file and you want to quickly search and paste them with choose. Here is a command that you can bind to some shortcut with something like Karabiner:
```bash
cat snippets_separated_with_two_newline_symbols.txt | choose -e -m -x \n\n - | pbcopy - && osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "v" using command down'
```

This will prompt choose, get its output, copy it to pasteboard, and trigger a paste shortcut `command+v`. 

For this to work in Karabiner, you need to give it access via Privacy & Security -> Accessibility -> karabiner_console_user_server (typically located at `/Library/Application Support/org.pqrs/Karabiner-Elements/bin/karabiner_console_user_server`), otherwise you will get `System Events got an error: osascript is not allowed to send keystrokes. (1002)`
